Advanced Calculator

This project is made for "JS Fundamentals cours" - Telecom Academy.
I used:
- Java Scripts (variables, functions, decisional structure, repetitive structure, class, objects, arrays, querySelector, addEventListener, switch),
- HTML (create structure with difrent tags, link css file, link script js file)
- CSS concepts (applaying style at general level, at class level, at id level, display flex, dispaly grip, border, size, color, background, import font family).

The result is an advanced intuitive calculator, easy to use, with a friendly interface. It will provide you what you expect, base on a normal past experience with similar calculators. 
The calculator retains previously  result and it will use it in future operation.
Also it uses decimals and it have a maximum number of decimals that it displays.
